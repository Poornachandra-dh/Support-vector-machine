# Support-vector-machine
🔍 Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier This project demonstrates the implementation and application of Support Vector Machines (SVM) — a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks.
Here’s a clean and professional **GitHub project description** for a Support Vector Machine (SVM) project. You can adjust it based on your specific use case (e.g., classification, regression, image recognition, etc.).
